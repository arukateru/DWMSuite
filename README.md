# DWMSuite
Disable, enable, backup, restore, and change DWM version.
Microsoft would like to have you think that DWM is a system-critical process, but in reality, it's not. DWM and its best friends, UWP apps, can completely brick your installation if they don't get their way even though it's otherwise totally usable. For example, I applied a corrupt theme and bricked my installation. After some troubleshooting, I disabled DWM from WinRE and sure enough, my computer booted fine. People also like to disable DWM for their games sometimes as it can prevent some problems. You may wish to also attempt to install a different version of DWM, which this will help you with.
